# CS210ProjectTwo Reflection Journal
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving. 
The goal of project two was to create a program that would calculate savings based on the user's input. Since this was meant to be used by the public it had to have 
an easy to use interface. The program had to account for the user putting in unexpected values as well. This means having to account for a wide range of inputs.

What did you do particularly well? 
The functions are logically organized. Previously I found myself putting most information into the main function or a few larger functions. This made the code hard 
to follow, even though I was the one who wrote it! To prevent this from happening again I followed the function structure given in the project. 

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on? 
The best thing I could do for my code is add clearer comments. More description of what each function does will be helpful if I try to make changes in the future. 
This could include adding descriptors for what each variable is for. When I was writing the code I found myself losing track of when each variable was needed. 
Renaming variables would also help solve this problem. 

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network? 
I found organizing the input variables to be very difficult. There were a few times where the math wasn't working the way it should. To fix this I worked backwards 
and only made small incremental changes. This made it easier to find the root cause.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work? 
Learning how to format output displays will be an important skill for me. I'm an artist who enjoys front end development. Making things look neat is a key skill for my 
future career development. 

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable? 
Separating each step into smaller functions helped make the program easy to follow and change. If I wanted to change the way the table is displayed I would only have 
to change the display related functions. That task would've been tedious if everything was lumped together in the main function.
